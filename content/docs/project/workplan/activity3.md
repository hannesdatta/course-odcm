# Activity #3: Extraction Design

## Overview
- Type: Meetup with your team during the coaching session 
- Goal: prepare team presentation with screen shots from the website/API that illustrate the design choices
- Presentation specifics
    - please target a presentation time of 3 minutes per team (+ 2 minutes discussion)
    - please pick one person to present; others can contribute in the discussion

## Preparation before the activity

- Before the session, carefully reread the relevant sections in ["Fields of Gold"](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F00222429221100750).

## Deliverables

During the coaching session, start preparing a presentation, covering
    - Title page: Team number & brief description of (updated) motivation for data context
    - Slide 1: Which information to extract from which pages/endpoints? (Challenge #2.1)
    - Slide 2: Which seeds to use as a starting point of the data collection? (Challenge #2.2)
    - Slide 3: At which frequency to extract information (Challenge #2.3)
        - please include a calculation of your study's feasible sample size.
    - Slide 4: How to process the information during the extraction? (Challenge #2.4)

Throughout, provide details on how your extraction design balances technical feasibility and exposure to potential legal and ethical risks (cf. Table 3 in "Fields of Gold").

- Please include the calculation of your study's feasible sample size in a separate Excel sheet.

- Please upload the presentation (as a PDF) and Excel sheet (as an Excel file) in one zip file, at the latest a day before the __presentation sessions__ (see schedule).


__Throughout the coaching session, please solicit the feedback of your coach.__
