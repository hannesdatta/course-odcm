## Technicalities & support

- Receiving your exam: via [TestVision](https://TilburgU.testvision.nl/online/kandidaten) on the examination dates.
- Working on your exam: on a computer at the University.
- Submitting your exam: all questions (including file uploads) will be submitted via TestVision

## Form

- On-campus computer exam
- Several sections with subquestions (some open questions: both in written, or by means of code/file uploads; also closed questions, such as multiple choice, or ranking questions)

{{< hint warning >}}

- Communication with anybody about the exam content is strictly prohibited.
- You will be able to download ["cheatsheets"](exam-material.zip) from the exam's introduction page.
- The exam makes use of the "open book" workspace. This means that technically, you are able to access the internet. However, it is strictly forbidden to use any other material accessible on the internet, other than described on the exam's cover page (which covers all the software used in class such as VS Code, Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, as well as Chrome, Edge and Firefox).
- The use of any other website/tool, including AI tools such as ChatGPT, OpenAI APIs, Bing Chat, Copilot, etc. is strictly forbidden.
- Students must not mention their names or student numbers in any of the submitted files, except when being explicitly asked to do so. This is to ensure the exam can be graded anonymously.

<!--
- Students must not copy-paste from websites, academic papers. The use of ChatGPT or similar AI-based tools is only allowed if stated explicitly for selected questions on the pratical part of the exam (given questions permit the use of the internet).

## Content

- The exam consists of __open and closed (multiple-choice, ranking, matching) questions__, structured along the [learning goals](../course/) of this course, and shown in __random order__.
- Cognitive skills that will be tested are knowledge, comprehension, analysis, application, synthesis and evaluation.
- You can expect to work three hours on the exam.
- Expect coding questions using Jupyter Notebook
  - Large(r) coding task (e.g., scrape data from a website or retrieve data from API) 
  - Small(er) coding task (e.g., parsing, fixing errors, running existing code)
  - Essay questions with indicated word limits to form a judgment (e.g., recommend website or API for a particular business problem, evaluate terms & conditions, sample size calculations)
- All tutorials - but not advanced web scraping and APIs - are relevant for these questions.

## Preparing for the exam

### Work on the example questions

Please [view the list of example questions here](examplequestions).

### Make your own example questions

- We encourage you to generate your own example questions. Just start from a combination of learning goals (e.g., learn how to scrape, "web scraping 101") and cognitive skill levels (e.g., "evaluation"). Combining these two dimensions will help you come up with a creative way of asking a good example question.
- See [this summary of Bloom's Taxonomy](https://mygrowthmindsethome.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/blooms-taxonomy.pdf), which we also use to generate exam questions.
- Curious whether your question is "good" - [send it to us via the usual ways](../course/support) - maybe it will even be part of the exam? ;)

### Familiarize yourself with TestVision

- [Take a practice test](https://oefentoetsen.testvision.nl/online/fe/login_ot.htm?campagne=tlb_demo_eng&taal=2) to familiarize yourself with TestVision!
- Get to know more about TestVision [here](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/studying/exams/e-assessment/testvision)

### Technical tips & beyond

- Verify that you are familiar with the on-campus computers so that you know how to use them (e.g., Windows, how to open Jupyter Notebook, how to navigate on the command prompt, etc.)
- Know how to zip and unzip files
- Make use of cheat sheets (e.g., available on this site or elsewhere) (you can also print them)
- Revise your code before submission so that you ensure it runs from top to bottom without problems.
- The inspect mode in Chrome and Edge is blocked. However, you can install Firefox on the computers and access the inspect mode there.
