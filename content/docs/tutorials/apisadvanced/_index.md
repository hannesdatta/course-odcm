# Tutorial: APIs Advanced

## Learning goals

- Apply filters, possibly for multiple endpoints, to narrow down search requests
- Iterate over a variety of API search and result pages
- Learn how to read API documentation independently
- Learn how to save JSON objects to new-line separated text files
- Learn how to parse JSON objects to tabular files from text input files
