__After the lecture__

- Work through the tutorial at your own pace.
- Watch ["What is web scraping and what are Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)?"](https://videocollege.uvt.nl/Mediasite/Play/41afff385bd74db2af5fb8507350ea521d) (30 minutes)
- Deepen your understanding of basic programming concepts by completing "Intro to Python for Data Science" (about 3 hours; [work on the first three chapters only](https://datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science))
