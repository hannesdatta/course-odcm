# Notes

## Commitment to students
- I communicate to you within three days.
- I respect your level of knowledge - whether advanced, or a beginner having troubles with my content
- I want to make the course relevant to you, and listen to what you need

## Forms of interaction

*Interactive, immersive and student-centred*

- live coding
- debates
- open-source content contributions

- scraping real websites and accessing real APIs

-	Motiveren: nut en motivatie brengen; intrinsiek gemotiveerd (!!!)
-	Live sessie met elkaar / peers gaan overleggen.
-	Entertaining zijn!

-	Bv break out groups per topic
-	Vragen individueel voorbereiden

-	“Mind map maken online?”
-	Gast college
-	Community
-	Overleg om projecten
-	Inhoud van de cursussen
-	Inspiratie leveren voor projecten

-	Inclusion of poorly performing students  uitleg momentje voor problems


# Notes / edits

## Live stream 1

- have screenshots about APIs and webscrapers
- have a video in which I show a scraper at work

## Live stream 2




## Data availability and research fit
- Preparation
- Check data availability



## other forms

- presentation
- pitch & defense (argument)
- searching for open data sets
- posting websites they like in the chat, organize those
- RQ
  - what are societally important research questions?
- interview w/ firms
- writing building blocks

- start projects with templates from GitHub
- share screens
- solve problems



- Modern content: copy-paste code snippets and demos from the course page, access code on GitHub, start projects with templates from GitHub, share screens and solve problems



- add cronjobs

## Future editions
- add MongoDB and MySQL
- add AWS

<!-- take home exercise: just submit; you get "DONE" on it as per the deadline -- make sure students stay up-to-date w/ the content


-->







- Building blocks
  - Logging in and out
  - Looping through seeds
  - Parsing
  - File remotes: pushing to S3 (e.g. HTML, sync)
  - automated zipping and wiping
  - making screenshots of sites or HTML files
  - Reconnect to open browser; versus open a new one / Keeping cookies / logins alive

- Questions/decision rules
  - assess space requirements (# files, HD space); storage may be transitory (e.g., database to support extraction); or permanent (CSV) -> if permanent, choose files

- Add to workflows
  - Job scheduling on Windows, Linux
    - of executing one job,
    - of executing multiple jobs;
    dynamic nature? (e.g., dynamic seeds, querying)
  - killing interfering processes
  - Monitoring: Server capacity, billing, diskspace
  - increasing limits (&limit=100), or elements on pages.
  - what other "relevant" data to capture?
    - monitor the firms' blogs, and put it in the paper.
    - save screenshots


# Legacy teaching notes



Appendix: A few notes to make this course a success
Stay up-to-date
Frequently check Canvas and your emails to stay up-to-date.
Work hard
This course requires you to work very hard. You will be exposed to material that you did not even know existed or was technically possible.
Generally speaking, you are expected to spend about 20 hours per week preparing the course, attending lectures and lab sessions, and working on assignments.
The workload may not be evenly distributed throughout the course, and students need to plan for this. Especially the first two session (data 1, data 2) and the accompanying lab sessions will take a lot of energy – make sufficient time available for self-study and group meetings.
Be on time, and start on time
Please arrive on time for online lectures and feedback sessions, and contribute to discussions, where possible. Mobile phones should be put in silent mode. You are expected to be well-prepared, even if the class takes place online.
Start working on your assignments early to avoid last-minute stress.
Working on and handing in assignments
You can use any software you want to estimate the various models or prepare the datasets. However, assistance is only given in Python, R, and SQL.
Reports have to be written in English. I will lower your grade if you are not communicating your ideas clearly.
If you feel you need to improve your writing skills, we have made good experience with Grammarly.
No late submissions can be accepted.
No hand-written answers assignments are accepted.
Assignments need to be handed in digital-only. See announcements on Canvas.
Informal Feedback
I strongly encourage you to provide feedback about both format and content during the course. You can do this via email (rsm@uvt.nl), or WhatsApp (+31134668938).

Official Course Evaluation
Next to informally evaluating the course, you are given a chance to fill in an anonymous online survey. We will announce this during the course. The survey will be accessible at tiu.nu/evaluate (Links to an external site.).

I strongly encourage everyone to participate in this survey. It will give me the chance to improve this course in the future. Also, it allows me to judge what you found useful and whether you liked the course in general. Given that I’ve put an enormous amount of effort into making this course suit your (academic and job market) needs, you owe me your honest opinion. Thanks in advance!

Communication
You do not have to address us with “Mr.”, “Dr.”, or “Prof.”. Just use the first name, but be respectful.
A few tips for the way you write emails (see also contact and communication, earlier in this syllabus)
Use a meaningful subject line
Identify yourself clearly (group number, team number)
Keep the message focused. The more concise, the better. Plus… you are more likely to get a quick reply.
Be kind - don’t flame
Write in English or Dutch
Do add us on LinkedIn (but not on Facebook)
Follow us on Twitter (@hannesdatta) or engage in discussions about the course or social media (#tilburgdigital).
Language
This course is taught in English.
You are obliged to speak English whenever there are international students present  (i.e., also during the online feedback sessions). If in doubt, you need to speak English.
Speaking English has several merits:
You are going to improve your language skills
International students can quickly join a conversation, and do not feel excluded.
Updates to this syllabus
This course book will be updated throughout the course. New versions will be published on Canvas. Please make sure to always use the latest one. The same holds for the readings and deadline list (may be published separately on Canvas).

Plagiarism
Plagiarism is strictly forbidden for any aspect of the course and, if detected, will be immediately reported:

using or copying his/her personal or other people’s texts, data, ideas or thoughts without adequate reference to the source;
presenting the structure or central body of thought from others without adequate reference to the source and thus passing it off as his/her own;
not clearly indicating literal or almost literal quotations in the text, for example via quotation marks or a certain layout;
paraphrasing the content of his/her own or other people’s texts without adequate reference to the source;
copying video, audio or test material, software, and program codes from others without adequate reference to the source and thus passing them off as his/her own;
copying work from fellow students and thus passing it off as his/her own.

For more details, please see the Teaching and Examination Regulations.

Grading
Grades are the outcome of an objective evaluation process. While students have the right to request feedback on their performance or progress, we do not discuss – let alone negotiate – grades.

In this course, a student’s final grade is based on several components, some of which may already be completed during the course itself such as a quiz. Typically, we will add your grades to Canvas, along with extra feedback and computational details.
