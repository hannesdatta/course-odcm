    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for combining programming and markdown (e.g., text, plots, equations), making it the default choice for sharing and presenting reproducible data analyses. Since we can execute code blocks one by one, it's suitable for developing and debugging code on the fly. \n",

    "\n",
    "First, the order in which you run cells within a notebook may affect the results. While prototyping, you may lose sight of the top-down hierarchy, which can cause problems once you restart the kernel (e.g., a library is imported after it is being used). Second, there is no easy way to browse through directories and files within a Jupyter Notebook. Third, notebooks cannot handle large codebases nor big data remarkably well. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we recommend starting in Jupyter Notebooks, moving code into functions along the way, and once all seems to be running well, copy-paste all necessary code into Spyder. From there, you can save it as a Python file (`.py`) - rather than a notebook (`.ipynb`) - and execute the file from the command line. Next, we introduce you to the Spyder IDE and learn how to run Python files from the command line. \n",
