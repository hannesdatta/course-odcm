# Overview and Agenda

## Why Legal Considerations Matter

- __Web scraping:__ Automated extraction of content from websites using scripts or crawlers. Not APIs provided by firms. But: some APIs are disguised scrapers!
- __But__: No “Web Scraping Act”: Overlapping laws + similar actions → radically different legal outcomes. 
  - anti-hacking  
  - contracts between you (researchers/students/employees) and the firm (data/service provider)
  - Intellectual property (IP) rights  
  - privacy law (GDPR in the EU)  
- Different jurisdictions treat scraping differently.
- Goal = **risk minimization** (not “perfect legality”).

## Agenda

1. Legal pillars underlying web scraping projects
2. Case studies
3. Risk minimization strategies
4. Summary


# 1. Legal Pillars

---

## Legal Pillar 1 — Technical Access

**Core idea:**  Does scraping bypass a technical barrier?

Examples of barriers:  

- Login walls  
- Session tokens  
- CAPTCHAs  
- IP rate limiting  
- Paywalls

High risk when:  

- You circumvent or bypass.  
- Even “reasonable circumvention” may count as unauthorized.

---

## Legal Pillar 2 — Intellectual Property (IP)

**Copyright** protects:  

- reviews, descriptions, photos, creative formatting  
- Does *not* protect facts (prices, timestamps)

**Database Right** (EU, Directive 96/9/EC)

- Protects investment in obtaining/structuring data  
- Infringed by “substantial extraction”  
- Applies even if data is factual

---

## Legal Pillar 2 — Intellectual Property (IP) (continued)

**TDM (Text & Data Mining) exceptions** (Digital Single Markets (DSM) Directive 2019/790)  


**Art. 3 (scientific research exception)**  

- Applies to *research organisations*  
- Covers commercial publishers' content  
- Rightholders **cannot** opt out  
- But does *not* override ToS or access restrictions

**Art. 4 (general TDM, applies to commercial userse)**  

- Applies to companies  
- BUT rightholders *may opt out* (e.g., via robots.txt or metadata)
- Still interacts with ToS


---

## Legal Pillar 3 — Terms of Service (Contracts)

Key forms: 

- **Clickwrap** — user clicks “I agree” → fully binding  
- **Browsewrap** — ToS linked but not clicked  
- **Sign-in-wrap** — ToS applied when logging in

Enforceable when:  

- Clear notice  
- Repeated, professional use (constructive notice)  
- User benefited from service


---

## Legal Pillar 4 — Privacy (GDPR)

- Any identifier → personal data  
  - usernames  
  - user IDs  
  - profile URLs  
- Sensitive data (Art. 9):  
  - biometric  
  - health  
  - politics  
  - religion  

---

## Legal Pillar 4 — Privacy (GDPR) (continued)

A scraping project needs **one** lawful basis:[^1]

- **Consent**: Explicit agreement (e.g., survey participants sharing profile data).
- **Contract**: Data needed to fulfil a contract (rare for scraping).
- **Legal obligation**: Required by law (not relevant for scraping).
- **Vital interests**: Life-saving situations (never relevant).
- **Public task**: Official/statistical bodies (rare in academic scraping).
- **Legitimate interest**: Possible for scraping public data **if** low risk + strong research benefit (example: studying price discrimination using publicly visible prices).

[^1]: GDPR Art. 6 lists six legal bases; legitimate interest requires a strict balancing test.

## Legal Pillar 4 — Privacy (GDPR) (continued)

- **Data minimisation**[^2]
  - Collect only data needed for the research question.  
  - Examples: studying prices → no need to store reviewer usernames; studying ratings → keep rating + timestamp, not profile IDs.  
- **Purpose limitation**[^2]
  - Use data only for the original purpose.  
  - Examples: scraped for price trends → cannot repurpose for predicting user gender; academic analysis → cannot turn dataset into a commercial product.
- **Security**[^2]
  - Protect data technically and organisationally.  
  - Examples: store raw HTML on encrypted university servers; restrict access to the research team; delete identifiers early; apply retention policies.

[^2]: GDPR Art. 5 sets out core principles: minimisation, purpose limitation, security.


# 2. Case studies

---

## Case 1 — hiQ Labs v LinkedIn (USA)

**Facts**  

- hiQ scraped *public* LinkedIn profiles  
- LinkedIn issued cease-and-desist  
- Claims: CFAA (anti-hacking), Breach of Terms of Service

 
**Computer Fraud and Abuse Act** (18 U.S.C. § 1030)

- US anti-hacking statute  
- Makes it illegal to access a computer “without authorization”  
- Historically used by platforms against scrapers


## Case 1 — hiQ Labs v LinkedIn (USA) (continued)

**Court**  

- Public pages does not imply unauthorized access (CFAA)[^hiq2]  
- BUT hiQ bound by clickwrap ToS → breach of contract

**Takeaway**  

- Anti-hacking and contract law do not imply the same thing
- But: allowed access does not mean being allowed to scrape

[^hiq2]: Ninth Circuit, 2019; reaffirmed 2022.

---

## Case 2 — Clearview AI (EU/UK)

**Facts**  

- Scraped billions of images from social media, news, blogs
- Built commercial facial-recognition search engine + sold to law enforcement + private sector

**GDPR Analysis**  

- Photos = *personal data*, Faces = *biometric data* (special category)[^gdpr9]  
- Requires explicit lawful basis (none existed)


## Case 2 — Clearview AI (EU/UK) (continued)

**Outcomes outcomes**: France (CNIL), Italy (Garante), Greece, UK (ICO) issued fines; orders to delete EU/UK residents’ data[^cnil]

**Takeaway**: Public availability does **not** override privacy law

[^gdpr9]: GDPR Art. 9.  
[^cnil]: CNIL Clearview Decision (2021). ICO Enforcement Notice (2022).

---

## Case 3 — Ryanair v PR Aviation (CJEU)

**Facts**  

- PR Aviation scraped public flight prices  
- Used in flight comparison tool  
- Ryanair sued based on: ToS, Possible Database Right

**Court**  

- Database Right did *not* apply (no substantial investment)  
- BUT Terms of Service were enforceable[^ryanair]
  - *Browsewrap*: ToS posted but not clicked  
  - *Constructive notice*: commercial user should know terms

**Takeaway**: ToS alone can block scraping—even for public data

[^ryanair]: CJEU C-30/14 (2015).

---

## Case 4 — Academic Research Case

**Facts**  
- Combined web scraping + API data  
- ToS explicitly forbade combining these sources  
- Collected usernames → personal data (GDPR)

**Outcome**  

- Dialogue with provider
- Agreed on data minimization steps for academic, non-commercial purpose

**Takeaway**  

- Research scraping = often a grey zone  
- Transparency and minimization reduce conflict

[^acad1]: Boegershausen, Datta, Borah & Stephen (2022), Appendix D.

---

## Why do these outcomes differ?

__Jurisdictions Disagree__

- **US**  
  - Anti-hacking focus  
  - Weak privacy law  
  - CFAA distinguishes public/private access  
- **EU**  
  - Strong privacy law (GDPR)  
  - Database Right  
  - Stronger ToS enforceability  
- **UK**  
  - GDPR-style privacy + strong contract law

**Implication:**  
Same scrape → different trigger → different outcome.

# 3. Risk Minimization Strategies

---

## Reduce Access Risk

__“There Is No Safe — Only Safer.”__

- Scrape public pages only  
- Avoid bypassing barriers  
- Respect robots.txt as a *signal*

Risk assessment: 

- Scraping behind a login → risk ↑↑  
- Solving CAPTCHA with automation → risk ↑↑  
- Using rotating proxies to evade blocking → risk ↑↑


---

## Reduce ToS Risk

- Read ToS  
- Contact provider  
- Document decisions  
- Avoid combining API + scraping if forbidden

---

## Reduce IP Risk

- Prefer factual fields  
- Avoid copying reviews, long text, images  
- Avoid bulk extraction of structured databases

## Reduce GDPR Risk

- Remove identifiers early  
- Avoid faces  
- Store raw data securely  
- Limit retention

## Reduce Purpose Risk:  

- Research < internal analytics < commercial reuse < resale

---

## Assessing a Project

- Data sensitivity  
- Technical intrusiveness  
- ToS conflict  
- Commercial visibility  
- Scale (volume/frequency)

**Case placements:**  

- hiQ — medium  
- Ryanair — medium-high  
- Academic — low-medium  
- Clearview — extreme

# 5. Summary

## Summary

- No unified scraping law  
- Same scraping → different outcomes because different legal pillars are triggered  
- Research scraping manageable with good practice  
- Commercial scraping of personal/biometric data = high risk
