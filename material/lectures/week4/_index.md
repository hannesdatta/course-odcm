# Week 4: Learn how to extract data from APIs

## Learning goals

- Send HTTP requests to a web API, and retrieve JSON responses
- Use parameters to modify the results of an API call
- Iterate over multiple pages of JSON responses
- Extract and store results of an API request in lists of dictionaries, and files


<!--Data Availability Assessment, Research Fit, Legal Audit

- Optional: Watch this screen cast in which I try to figure out how to [obtain data from an API that I haven't seen before](https://youtu.be/iDA710TPXT0)
  - The video may be particularly useful to students who wish to extract data from an API for their team projects.
