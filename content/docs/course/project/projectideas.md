# Project ideas

*Note: The final team projects (and team allocations) are available on the course's (non-public) Canvas page.*

Here's a list with a couple of project ideas. __Don't feel restricted by these options, though!__ There are plenty of other great ideas (e.g., see the [examples section](../../../examples)), and we encourage you to think of applications in which you use two or more APIs, or in which you combine web scraping with relevant APIs.

When using a proprietary data sources requiring login (e.g., Netflix) or API credentials (e.g., Twitter API), make sure you can *actually* get access to the accounts (and potentially share those with team members).



<!--Research Context

Skilling up in web scraping and APIs requires practice, and conducting a group project is a great way to learn more about any facet of data- or computer science. Choose one of the following questions to explore further or pitch your own one during one of the live meetings in the course!

### Online music streaming and podcasts
- [spotifycharts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional)
- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

<!--
- Potential research questions
  - Compare the rankings across countries throughout time (2017-2021)
      - How long do tracks typically stay in the top 200?

      - What is the relative market share of music streaming in comparison to global figures?
      - Can tracks that fell off the track, bounce back and climb up the rankings again?
      - Do the total number of streams significantly fluctuate throughout time?
    - Can you find clusters of countries that share the same music taste?

### Concerts and events
- [Songkick](https://www.songkick.com/developer)

### E-commerce
- [bol.com](bol.com)
- [Coolblue](coolblue.nl)
<!--

   - Are customer reviews comparable across platforms?
   - How are products ordered by default?
-->

### Social media

<!--
- Potential research questions
  - Which movie genres are most popular, and are most likely to be trending?
  - Are Netflix originals promoted more often on the homescreen than other movies?
  - Are the highest rated movies also the ones most popular on Netflix?
-->

### Online videos, user-generated content
- [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)
- [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api)

<!--
- Potential research questions
  - What are the most popular types of YouTube channels in terms of views?
  - Did watchtime and views go up for these channels since the COVID-19 outbreak?
  - Do the channels with the most subscribers also earn the most? (e.g., see [Socialblade](https://socialblade.com/youtube/))
  - What factors play a role in determining the "Socialblade" channel grade?
  - How can you identify upcoming Youtubers that show great potential for an advertising partnership?
  - How does Twitch help creators earn money and build their fandom?
