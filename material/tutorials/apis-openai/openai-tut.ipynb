    "Welcome to the **API Advanced Tutorial**, introducing you to an advanced API for using AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we'll start with a brief introduction to APIs and go over some essential programming tools. We'll use a simple analogy to help explain how different models in the OpenAI API work, and we'll carry that analogy throughout the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn the building blocks for using generative AI in research. We'll also cover important topics like data privacy and security when working with AI tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an OpenAI account and set up your API key\n",
    "- Understand how to send and receive requests using the OpenAI API\n",
    "- Use different models such as text generation-, speech-, and embeddings models\n",
    "- Be aware of costs, limitations, and ethical considerations\n"
