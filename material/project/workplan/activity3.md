# Activity #3: Extraction Design

## Overview
- Type: Meetup with your team during the coaching session 
- Goals: receive feedback on your data extraction plan

## Preparation before the activity

- Before the session, carefully reread the relevant sections in ["Fields of Gold"](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F00222429221100750).
- Your data extraction likely needs some of the advanced material available in the (optional) [advanced tutorials](../resources/tutorials). This may already be relevant to some teams this week - so ensure that at least some of your team members have taken a look at the content.

## Session structure

- Please start working on your data extraction plan by deciding on which information to retrieve, for which seeds, at what frequency, and how to process the data during the collection (challenges #2.1-#2.4)
- Then, prepare a team presentation with screen shots from the website/API to illustrate your data extraction plan (5 minutes per team; pick one person to present)

{{< hint info >}}
__Please adhere to the following presentation structure__
- Title page: Team number & brief description of (updated) motivation for data context
- Slide 1: Which information to extract from which pages/endpoints? (Challenge #2.1)
- Slide 2: Which seeds to use as a starting point of the data collection? (Challenge #2.2)
- Slide 3: At which frequency to extract information (Challenge #2.3)
  - please include a calculation of your study's feasible sample size.
- Slide 4: How to process the information during the extraction? (Challenge #2.4)

Throughout, provide details on how your extraction design balances technical feasibility and exposure to potential legal and ethical risks (cf. Table 3 in "Fields of Gold").

Please upload the presentation (as a PDF) and Excel sheet (as an Excel file) in one zip file, at the latest a day before the __presentation sessions__ (see schedule).

__Throughout the coaching session, please solicit the feedback of your coach.__

- Conduct background research on the *current legal situation* on using w)eb scraping and APIs: When is it allowed, and when not? What are ethical boundaries?
