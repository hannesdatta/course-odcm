# Week 1: Getting started with Python and web data

## Learning goals

- Get to know Python
- Launch Jupyter Notebook and run code in Visual Studio Code
- Know when itâ€™s useful to use Google Colab in the cloud (vs. Jupyter Notebook)
- Understand basic programming concepts in Python and their applications to collecting web data

## Preparation before the lecture

- Ensure you have completed all preparations, including software installation at Datacamp licenses, before the lecture. [Find out more...](../prep).
