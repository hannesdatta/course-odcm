When using a proprietary data sources requiring login (e.g., Netflix) or API credentials (e.g., Twitter API), make sure you can *actually* get access to the accounts (and potentially share those with team members).

<!--Research Context

Skilling up in web scraping and APIs requires practice, and conducting a group project is a great way to learn more about any facet of data- or computer science. Choose one of the following questions to explore further or pitch your own one during one of the live meetings in the course!
