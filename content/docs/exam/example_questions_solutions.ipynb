Users located in these countries could not see the number of likes on media posted by others, whereas users living anywhere else could still view like counts (Loren 2020). Thus, treatment groups enter the treated pool of persons sequentially, and assignment to the treatment or control condition was dependent on users’ geography.* \n"
