# About

Web scraping and APIs have become one of the most important data collection methods in academic (marketing) research. While you can find many resources on *how to scrape*, or *how to access data from APIs*, none of these tutorials will teach you how the way you scrape affects your research. This is the void we will.

We've used web scraping and APIs in our research for more than 10 years. And we're (finally) ready to pass on the knowledge to you. Even if you're not enrolled in our class, you can make use of our material.

Feedback is appreciated always.
