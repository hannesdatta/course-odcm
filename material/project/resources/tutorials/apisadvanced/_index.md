# Tutorial: APIs Advanced

## Learning goals

- Understand the various ways on how to authenticate with an API (e.g., credentials, tokens)
- Obtain authentication credentials and tokens via the API calls, check for a valid connection, and renew tokens if they expire (beware: procedures for authentication can be different for each API!)
- Apply filters, possibly for multiple endpoints, to narrow down search requests
- Iterate over a variety of API search and result pages
- Learn how to read API documentation independently
- Learn how to save JSON objects to new-line separated text files
- Learn how to parse JSON objects to tabular files from text input files
