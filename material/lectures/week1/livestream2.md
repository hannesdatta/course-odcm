# Teaching Notes for opening lecture

10.45-1.30

10.45-11.45 Opening lecture + brain storm for data collections

Break

12.00-01.30 Python Bootcamp





1. Welcome!
  1. Sign-up to Canvas completed? Need for registration
  2. Time to help me w/ editing videos? Let me know in the chat
  3. Student whatsapp groups / discord: post link now
  4. Pulse is out there: login at pulse.tilburg-digital.com [beware: in dev.]
2. Today’s topic: the tutorials and self-study
  1. We’ll start with a little activity (5 minutes, breakout)
      1. Mix in breakout groups at random: tell each other what sites you’re on / you would love to scrape / insights you'd like to generate
      2. Do a little search what OTHER websites are available
      3. Discuss commonalities and differences between web scraping and APIs
  2. Gather thoughts in a joint document.
3. Take questions on material so far
4. Python Bootcamp (Tutorial)
  1. Run a quick survey
          1. Completed installation of Python/Anaconda
          2. Completed Introduction to Python on Datacamp
          3. Got familiar with Jupiter Notebook (the 30-minute video)
          4. Worked through the tutorial
          5. Used Google Colab
          6. Used my own Computer
  2. Discuss difference between Anaconda, Python, Jupyter Notebook, and operating systems
  3. Explain need for Python
      1. Multi-purpose (web server, web scraping, automating, machine learning)
      2. High-level, relatively easy to learn
      3. Good documentation
      4. Open source
      5. Widely used in business/data science
      6. Platform independent
  4. Go through content of Datacamp Course [pick stuff from it, explain why it matters]
      1. Variables and types: e.g., string, e.g., number
      2. Type conversions: e.g., iteration number (print!)
      3. Python list (e.g., list of URLs): create a list
      4. Refer to a list
      5. Append to a list
      6. Importing packages
      7. Writing a function (functions, e.g., hello world, scrape function)
  5. Get familiar w/ Jupyer Notebook
      1. Starting up Jupyter (navigator, command prompt)
      2. Using Jupyter in the cloud (Google Colab) + discuss drawbacks
      3. Explain interface (code, text)
      4. Explain how to run code
      5. Explain Python runs top down / common errors
      6. Explain what happens when it crashes and how to solve it
      7. Explain how it is different from “regular” Python
          1. Not production ready
          2. Will have to convert to .py and run top down for production scripts
          3. Browser version doesn’t support advanced tutorials
  6. Content in the notebook
      1. Conditional logic
          1. Why needed for scraping: if iteration = 100: break
          2. If statements
          3. And, or operators
      2. Dictionaries versus list
          1. Lists are cool, dictionaries are more powerful because we can label stuff
          2. Accessing data from dictionaries
          3. Adding data
      3. Looping
          1. Why it’s important
          2. Example w/ looping through lists
          3. Example in which I want to calculate in lists w/ scraping
          4. Loop through ranges
          5. While loop w/ emojis
          6. Writing more efficient loops (.85 * price for price in prices
      4. Why functions
          1. Wrap stuff in functions!
          2. Variable scope
          3. Parameters
          4. Returning values
      5. Debugging
          1. Stackoverflow, etc.
          2. Try except
      6. Reading/writing text files
