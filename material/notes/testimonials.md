# Testimonials

To get an idea of how students of previous editions of this course thought of it, we included some of the main points mentioned in the course evaluation by them below.

## About the course
- _This course has significantly improved my
coding skills. Hannes took the time to look at our
code in multiple coaching sessions. He was also
always available through Whatsapp etc. I also
appreciate his effort in making pulse (a
website tracking your progress). The example code
in Google Colab was also beneficial. Also,
Hannes is a very inspiring teacher who really
encouraged us to go the extra mile._

- _It is relevant, and the content is closely linked
to what is expected later on in the program. This
fit makes the course, in my opinion, an excellent fit
with marketing analytics, and it is very useful later
in life, compared to other classes that entirely focus
on theoretical learning._

- _I was positively surprised that Tilburg
University teaches scraping skills. I've never heard
of any other university teaching that. It's also
forward-thinking: these skills will be helpful in the
future. I'd never started learning scraping on my own
because I always thought it was very complicated, but
it turned out to be doable. Pulse is an excellent
addition to the course since there isn't a book that
would teach us that. Team consults were helpful
with solving the code issues. I like that the teacher
is passionate about what he teaches._

- _Pretty cool skills I obtained from this class.
I couldn't imagine I would know how to scrape data
online._

- _Truly, one of the best courses I have taken in all my years at Tilburg University. It's super refreshing, it's new, it's modern, it's not a model that hasn't been refined since decades... Prior to the course I was a bit wary of Python due to previous traumas from earlier assignments in my bachelor that rested on a very inadequate knowledge of Python, but this course has definitely helped get me over it. I will definitely use the skills I have learned in this course for life._

- _This course has opened new perspectives for me and now I am eager to try my own projects. I really feel that what I have learned is useful. I felt inspired by the teacher and I really enjoyed listening to him. I wish there was more time to learn things from him._

## About the team project and tutorials

- _I really liked the setup of this course. Figuring
out what to do for the project really
inspired and motivated everyone to do their best._

- _The structure was really nice. The assignments
and tutorials aligned very well with the project. It
was nice to put things into practice._

- _The course has clear objectives and is a great
introduction to data collection with scraping and
APIs. With Google Colab, I could access 
structured assignments to prepare and get familiar
with the material._

- _Collecting web data seems like a straightforward process, but during the course you realize there are a lot of things you have to look out for if you want to do it right. I think the methods in this course give a good understanding on how to get there, which feels super useful!_

- _The teaching style was impeccable. Every single question was promptly answered by the professor who was always present and supportive. The humor used during class made everything more fun and enjoyable._
