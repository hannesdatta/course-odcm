# Final exam

The course content will be tested in the form of a computer exam, taken on campus (3 hours).

## Date & time

### Main sit

- On campus, 3 hours: {{< param "Course_Exam_MainsitTheory" >}}
- Exam registration: via Osiris
<!--- Time: __9.00am - 12pm (i.e., 11.59am + 1 minute)__ (Amsterdam time, you can start when you want, but *must* submit before the deadline)-->

### Resit

- On campus, 3 hours: {{< param "Course_Exam_ResitTheory" >}}
- Exam registration: via Osiris

<!--- Time: __9.00am - 12pm (i.e., 11.59am + 1 minute)__ (Amsterdam time, you can start when you want, but *must* submit before the deadline)-->

## Technicalities & support

- Receiving your exam: via [TestVision](https://TilburgU.testvision.nl/online/kandidaten) on the examination dates.
- Working on your exam: on a computer at the University.
- Submitting your exam: all questions (including file uploads) will be submitted via TestVision
- 
## Form

- On-campus exam (closed book except selected course material that students can download on the instruction page of the exam)
- Several sections with subquestions (all open questions; both in written, or by means of code/file uploads)
<!--- Some questions will be personalized (i.e., there is only one correct answer per student)
-->

{{< hint warning >}}

- Communication with anybody about the exam content is strictly prohibited.
- Students must not copy-paste from websites, academic papers. The use of ChatGPT or similar AI-based tools is only allowed if stated explicitly for selected questions on the pratical part of the exam (given questions permit the use of the internet).
- Students must not mention their names or student numbers in any of the submitted files, except when being explicitly asked to do so. This is to ensure the exam can be graded anonymously.

## Content

### Theoretical questions

- This part of the exam consists of __personalized open and closed (multiple-choice) questions__, shown in __random order__ (i.e., not in order of difficulty or weight/points).
<!--- Students __*cannot* go back between questions__ (i.e., questions need to be answered in the order in which they appear).-->
<!--- Allocate approximately 45 minutes to work on this part.-->
- Cognitive skills that will be tested are knowledge, comprehension, and analysis.

### Practical questions

- This part of the exam consists of __personalized open questions__, shown in __random order__ (i.e., not in order of difficulty or weight/points).
- Expect three questions (potentially w/ smaller subquestions), mixing "mix" various learning goals. For example:
  - Small coding task (e.g., parsing, fixing errors, running existing code) (20 minutes)
  - Small essay to form a judgment (e.g., recommend website or API for a particular business problem, evaluate terms & conditions, sample size calculations) (15 minutes)
  - Large(r) coding task (e.g., scrape data from a website or retrieve data from API) (remaining time)
- Cognitive skills that will be tested are application, evaluation, and synthesis/creation.
- All tutorials are relevant for these questions.

## Preparing for the exam

### Work on the example questions

Please [view the list of example questions here](examplequestions).

### Make your own example questions

- We encourage you to generate your own example questions. Just start from a combination of learning goals (e.g., learn how to scrape, "web scraping 101") and cognitive skill levels (e.g., "evaluation"). Combining these two dimensions will help you come up with a creative way of asking a good example question.
- See [this summary of Bloom's Taxonomy](https://mygrowthmindsethome.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/blooms-taxonomy.pdf), which we also use to generate exam questions.
- Curious whether your question is "good" - [send it to us via the usual ways](../course/support) - maybe it will even be part of the exam? ;)

### Familiarize yourself with TestVision

- [Take a practice test](https://oefentoetsen.testvision.nl/online/fe/login_ot.htm?campagne=tlb_demo_eng&taal=2) to familiarize yourself with TestVision!
- Get to know more about TestVision [here](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/studying/exams/e-assessment/testvision)

### Technical tips & beyond

- Verify that you are familiar with the on-campus computers so that you know how to use them (e.g., Windows, how to open Jupyter Notebook, how to navigate on the command prompt, etc.)
- Know how to zip and unzip files
- Make use of cheat sheets (e.g., available on this site or elsewhere) (you can also print them)
- Revise your code before submission so that you ensure it runs from top to bottom without problems.
