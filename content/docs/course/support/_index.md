▪	Please provide a concise description of what you have tried already

__Submitting code for feedback__

When submitting code (e.g., as a Jupyter Notebook) for feedback, please ensure that it __runs from top to bottom without errors__ - up to the point where you need feedback. In other words, __don't send "incomplete" code__ in which you ask us to debug a scraper, without actually loading the website.

Please also make use of specific comments in your code to explain the problem. This will help us to help you quicker.
