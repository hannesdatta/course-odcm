    "### Web Scraping &rarr; Part 1\n",
    "Web scraping involves extracting information from __publicly available websites__ by analyzing their HTML structure. It is useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No API is available for the data you need.\n",
    "- The website provides information in a structured format (tables, lists, etc.).\n",
    "- You want to extract elements like text, numbers, images, or links.\n",
    "\n",
    "### APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) &rarr; Part 2\n",
    "APIs provide a structured way to retrieve data directly from a website's backend. Instead of scraping HTML, APIs return data in machine-readable formats (e.g., JSON, XML). APIs are preferable when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The website offers a well-documented API.\n",
    "- You need structured data that is easier to process.\n",
    "- The website enforces rate limits or terms that prohibit scraping.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "It's vital to take some time to get familiar with HTML - the primary programming language used when building websites. Once we're familiar with HTML (and the structure of websites), we can rapidly navigate complex websites to extract the information we're interested in (e.g., prices, names of product categories, ...). In other words: to reach our end goal, we do have to give you some technical details first.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here we go: A web page consists of various text files, each one with its style, formatting, and syntax. These files each serve a specific purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.html` (HyperText Markup Language) files give structure to a page (e.g., where's the menu?, which content to show (e.g., text, tables)?)\n",
    "- `.css` (Cascading Style Sheet) files determine how the page looks (e.g., which color do headers have? what's the font used for text in a paragraph?)\n",
    "- `.js` (JavaScript) files add interactivity (e.g., button animations)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's try it out\n",
    "Check out this simple [example](https://codepen.io/rcyou/pen/QEObEk/). The site shows the source code of a site (`.html`, `.css`, and `.js`) in an online editor, along with a rendered (\"viewable\") version of the site.

    "\n",
    "#### Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to store raw data from websites (we will make use of this a lot). But &#150; how can extract specific information from a website, such as a product's title or price? \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we can make use of the *structured* nature of HTML, by selecting information on the basis of:\n",
    " \n",
    "- tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<table>`),\n",
    "- attributes \n",
    "    - such as IDs (e.g., `<table id=\"example-table\">`), \n",
    "    - class names (e.g., `<table class=\"striped-table\">`), or\n",
    "    - or (generic) attribute-value pairs (e.g., `<table data-gr-ext-installed=\"test\">`).\n",
    "    \n",
    "For now, we'll show you how to apply these concepts using *BeautifulSoup*, a fantastic Python library that allows you to navigate and extract data from HTML files. BeautifulSoup does NOT gather information from the web itself (for this, we still use `requests`, as above). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's try it out\n",
    "First, we import the package `BeautifulSoup` and turn the `web_request_source_code` (the HTML code from the website) into BeautifulSoup object.

Think of an authentication key as a \"key to unlock the service.\" Web services use such authentication keys to track whether you're allowed to use the API and how much you use it. This offers numerous opportunities for API business models, in which, for example, the service employs a pay-by-request (or by 1,000 requests) model. For example, check how to pay for the API of Chat GPT -- see https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction.\n",

    "### 2.5 Wrap up: APIs versus web scrapers\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand what APIs are, you may rightfully wonder: why should I learn APIs when I could scrape the elements from the website instead (like on music-to-scrape.org)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the major advantages of APIs is that you can directly access the data you need *without all the hassle of selecting the right HTML tags*. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Another advantage is that you can often customize your API request (e.g., the first x featured artists), which may not always be possible in the web interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using APIs is a legitimate way to access website data (mostly, you will have to pay a license fee to use APIs!). So it's a more stable and legit way to retrieve web data than web scraping. __That's also why we recommend using an API whenever possible.__\n",
    "\n",
    "- In practice, though, APIs really can't give you all the data you possibly want, and web scraping allows you to access complementary data (e.g., viewable on a website or somewhere hidden in the source code).\n",
    "\n",
    "More commonalities and differences are also shown in Web Appendix of [\"Fields of Gold\"](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F00222429221100750), Table W1.\n",
