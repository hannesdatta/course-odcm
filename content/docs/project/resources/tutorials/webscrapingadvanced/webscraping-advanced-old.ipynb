    "\n",
    "In the Web Scraping 101 tutorial, we mainly used BeautifulSoup to turn HTML into a data structure that we could search and access using Python-like syntax. While it's easy to get started with this library, it has limitations when it comes to dynamic websites. That is, websites of which the content changes after each page refresh. Selenium can handle both static and dynamic websites and mimic user behavior (e.g., scrolling, clicking, logging in). It launches another web browser window in which all actions are visible which makes it feel more intuitive. For example, the video below launches a regular Google Chrome window and visits [`instagram.com`](https://www.instagram.com). This browser window behaves like normal, so you can click on buttons and fill out fields. Yet you can distinguish it from your normal web browser by the header that indicates that Chrome is being controlled by automated test software. Before you can try it out yourself, we need to install some additional software which we'll explain next. \n",
