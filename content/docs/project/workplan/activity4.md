# Activity #4: Prototype Development

## Overview
- Type: Code (preferred) or screencast
- Goal: finalize a first, working prototype & get feedback

## Preparation before the activity

- __Complete the advanced web scraping or API tutorial__.
  - Your data extraction likely needs some of the advanced material available in the (optional) [advanced tutorials](../resources/tutorials). Pick the one that best suits your data source and complete it before building your prototype!

- You *can* submit - for live feedback - one or more of the following works. Note that it is not *mandatory* to upload material. Instead, the submissions should be seen as a way to receive feedback on your projects.

  - Start __building a prototype script__ (Jupyter Notebook, or `.py` file) that demonstrates your data extraction/scraping code. You can also use your script to illustrate some of the technical hurdles you are facing. Please test whether the script/Notebook runs correctly (e.g., open it on another computer, and run it top to down). Make use of comments in your code to point users to problems.

  - If you're team has not managed to write code yet, you can record a __short screencast__ (max. 2 minutes), in which you *illustrate how your extraction software* will have to navigate on the website/through the API ("navigation path"). Your raw recording can be longer than 2 minutes, BUT, you are required to trim it to 2 minutes in the final submission. In other words - we recommend you cut "silent moments" (e.g., when a website is being loaded). Please have a voice-over, in which you explain how your scraper will have to navigate on the site, including when to loop, and how to use pagination.

  __Submission__

  Please upload on Canvas (in one zip file), at the latest by 9am on the day *preceding* the next coaching session.Code and screencasts will be shared with other teams, so make sure your work is understandable (e.g., by using comments, being sufficiently elaborate)! Indicate your team number in the file names.


## Session structure

- During the coaching session, the coach will have reviewed the uploaded material and discuss any remaining issues with the team.
- Make sure to address any questions pertaining to challenges #3.1-3.3 with your coach.

__Throughout the coaching session, please solicit the feedback of your coach.__
