# Self- and peer assessment

Students' team project grades will be corrected upwards or downwards, depending on students' *individual contribution* to the overall team effort (e.g., measured by means of scoring themselves and their team members on, among others, the quantity and quality of their contributions).

__Calculating students' individual contribution to the team project__

1. Students score themselves and other team members on the following questions (answered on a scale between 1 = lowest, and 5 = highest)
  - How was the pro-active attitude of the student?
  - How was the student as a team player?
  - How was the sense of responsibility of the student?
  - How was the punctuality of the student with respect to internal deadlines?
  - How was the time and energy devoted of this student?
  - How was the quantity of the contribution of the student?
  - How was the quality of the contribution of the student?

2. Compute average score from (1) for each student within a team, across all questions. ("How did team members rate the focal student?")

3. Compute average team effort score, by averaging (within each team) the scores obtained in (2). ("What was the overall team effort?")

4. Compute students' self- and peer assessment score (`SPAscore`), by dividing each student's score by the team average. ("How did the student perform, relative to the overall team effort?"

5. Multiply the team project grade with the `SPAscore`, to arrive at the individual contribution to the team project.
