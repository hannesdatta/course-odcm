__Before sending an email, please...__
- let us know who you are (e.g., your first and last name)
- if it concerns a team issue, please always CC your entire team (or, in case of WhatsApp, create a group and add us to it). We will always reply to all.
-	If it concerns a question about programming or data… have you tried to solve your issue independently first?
o	No… not yet…
▪	Please first talk to fellow students about it
▪	Please first search on the web (e.g., on Google, on Stackoverflow.com)
o	Yes, I tried to
▪	Please provide a concise description of what you have tried already
▪	Please provide some screenshots and/or videos
▪	Please provide us with code and data, so that we can actually experiment with your specific problem to find a solution
-	you can send us your files via https://send.uvt.nl (data transfers of up to 10 GB); of course, wetransfer.com, Dropbox or Google Drive works, too
-	we may choose to setup a TeamViewer session to help you– please download (the free version of) TeamViewer and have your ID and password ready should we request it from you (https://www.teamviewer.com/nl/teamviewer-automatisch-downloaden/)

There is a three-day answer policy for both e-mail and WhatsApp. If you do not get a reply, please re-send your request.

Note that e-mails to any personal account of the course coordinator or lecturers concerning questions are not subject to the three-day answer policy, and may be left unanswered.

## Chatbot

In collaboration with tilburg.ai, we offer a Chatbot trained on course materials. Powered by the latest OpenAI Chat Completion API, it provides an interface similar to ChatGPT. Use it to get quick feedback or ask course-related questions. Start your chat now!

Please note that the Chatbot is in a pilot phase and may make mistakes. Conversations may be monitored anonymously by tilburg.ai and the course coordinator to improve the tool and potentially roll it out to other courses at Tilburg University.

## WhatsApp

For quick questions, please use *WhatsApp* to get in touch with us (+31 13 466 8938).

- Be as specific as possible (e.g., include screenshots, your Jupyter Notebooks or other source code, errors) so that we can help you better.
- Informal language is perfectly fine.
- Be prepared that we call you back if that makes solving a question easier.

<!--- We may ask you for permission to share the conversation with other students on the course's FAQ page. Names/etc. are of course taken out! If you don't wish your issue to be shared with others, simply say so!

## E-Mail
You can also send us an email to get in touch with us, but note that response times may be slower than through WhatsApp.

__Submitting code for feedback__

When submitting code (e.g., as a Jupyter Notebook) for feedback, please ensure that it __runs from top to bottom without errors__ - up to the point where you need feedback. In other words, __don't send "incomplete" code__ in which you ask us to debug a scraper, without actually loading the website.

Please also make use of specific comments in your code to explain the problem. This will help us to help you quicker.
