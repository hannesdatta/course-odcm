    "### 1.1 What is web scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that you want to capture and analyze data from a website. Of course, you could simply copy-paste the data from each page. But, of course, this manually executed job would have severe limitations. What if the data on the page gets updated (i.e., would you have time available to copy-paste the new data, too)? Or what if there are simply so many pages that you can't possibly do it all by hand (i.e., thousands of product pages)? \n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping can help you overcome these issues __by programmatically extracting data from the web__. Before we can extract/grab/capture/scrape information from a website, we need a bit of background on how websites work technically, so let's focus on that first.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "It's vital to take some time to get familiar with HTML - the primary programming language used when building websites. Once we're familiar with HTML (and the structure of websites), we can rapidly navigate complex websites to extract the information we're interested in (e.g., prices, names of product categories, ...). In other words: to reach our end goal, we do have to give you some technical details first.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here we go: A web page consists of various text files, each one with its style, formatting, and syntax. These files each serve a specific purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.html` (HyperText Markup Language) files give structure to a page (e.g., where's the menu?, which content to show (e.g., text, tables)?)\n",
    "- `.css` (Cascading Style Sheet) files determine how the page looks (e.g., which color do headers have? what's the font used for text in a paragraph?)\n",
    "- `.js` (JavaScript) files add interactivity (e.g., button animations)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's try it out\n",
    "Check out this simple [example](https://codepen.io/rcyou/pen/QEObEk/). The site shows the source code of a site (`.html`, `.css`, and `.js`) in an online editor, along with a rendered (\"viewable\") version of the site. Once you make changes to the code, the site gets automatically updated.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to store raw data from websites (we will make use of this a lot). But &#150; how can extract specific information from a website, such as a product's title or price? \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we can make use of the *structured* nature of HTML, by selecting information on the basis of:\n",
    " \n",
    "- tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<table>`),\n",
    "- attributes \n",
    "    - such as IDs (e.g., `<table id=\"example-table\">`), \n",
    "    - class names (e.g., `<table class=\"striped-table\">`), or\n",
    "    - or (generic) attribute-value pairs (e.g., `<table data-gr-ext-installed=\"\">`).\n",
    "    \n",
    "For now, we'll show you how to apply these concepts using *BeautifulSoup*, a fantastic Python library that allows you to navigate and extract data from HTML files. BeautifulSoup does NOT gather information from the web itself (for this, we still use `requests`, as above). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's try it out\n",
    "First, we import the package `BeautifulSoup` and turn the `book_source_code` (the HTML code from the \"A Light in the Attic\" webpage we used earlier) into BeautifulSoup object. Once converted, we can easily navigate the code by *tag names*, *attribute names*, or *class names*. This process is called __parsing__, and is one of the central tasks in web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that the title is surrounded by `<h1>` tags (see Google Inspector screenshot above), we use `soup.find('h1')` to parse the title of the book.\n",
