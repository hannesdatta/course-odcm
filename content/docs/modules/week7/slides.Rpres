Positioning in the study program
========================================================

![odcm](odcm_positioning.png)

Lessons learnt #1: Why to use web data?
========================================================
incremental: true

- Research is by far more impactful than non-webdata-based research
  - Explore novel phenomena, be timely!
  - Boost ecological value, get closer to what managers are interested in!
  - Facilitate methodological advancement (e.g., text, video)
  - Better measurement (e.g., control variables)
- But: challenging!
  - Programming skills to master technical challenges
  - Conceptual thinking to navigate design choices & legal risks
  
Lessons learnt #2: Staying in balance
========================================================
incremental: true

![odcm](methodological_framework.png)

__Let's generate a few examples where validity, legal and technical goals conflicted in your projects.__

Lessons learnt #3: Data Source Selection
========================================================
incremental: true

- Important of "broadening horizon" (e.g., assume perspective of various stakeholders, exceed geographical boundaries, use aggregators rather than primary data providers)
- Consider alternatives to scraping (i.e., avoid defaulting! e.g., APIs, but also ready-made data sets)
- Scope the data context (i.e., understand how the data is generated, assess reliability of the data, explore user conversations about the data, etc.)

Lessons learnt #4: Design Challenges (I)
========================================================
incremental: true

- Look out for information - especially the "surprising ones!"
- Look out for *variables* (e.g., to compare to other studies), but also to see *time availability* differences
- Spend time mapping your navigation path
- Real-time data collection required?! (e.g., wrong historical data, inaccurate timestamps?)
- Algorithmic biases present? Can exert control?

Lessons learnt #5: Design Challenges (II)
========================================================
incremental: true

- How long does the data collection run?
- How to sample/seed?
- To which population do the seeds generalize?
- At what frequency to extract the data (e.g., once? multiple times?)
- How to process the data on-the-fly? (e.g., first store as JSON, then parse; pandas-based parsing)

Lessons learnt #6: Design Challenges (III)
========================================================
incremental: true

- Scientific purpose, and run by research institution?
- Scale and scope? (all data vs. small sample? running time)
- Location of data provider and users
- "Go" decision from provider? Technical intrusiveness?
- Data management & use, commercialization

Lessons learnt #7: Extraction
========================================================
incremental: true

- Prototyping is extremely important
  - `requests` + `beautifulSoup` vs. `selenium` (Chromedriver)
  - extraction methodology (e.g., tags, classes, attribute-values) + stability
  - array misalignment (obey the hierarchy of stuff/how it is structured!!!)
  - scheduling, hiding passwords
  - revise navigation paths
  - add comments to code (make it understandable for others, e.g., using ChatGPT)
- Start documentation from a readme template
  - Generate plots, descriptive stats
  - Think as a "data supplier" rather than narrowly focusing on *one* (research) question

Lessons learnt #8: Web Scraping in Retailing
========================================================

- Based on Guyt et al. 2024
- Research opportunities
- Hands-on-framework: Extraction, Looping, Timing, Infrastructure
- Challenges & Opportunities for Retail Scraping
  - Overcoming matching challenges and time alignment
  - LLMs for web scraping

Looking ahead: Recognizing Limitations
========================================================
incremental: true

- Web data entails modeling challenges - not covered in this course (e.g., self-selection, "messy" data)
- Web data can't give you all (i.e., you don't see internal data such as clickstream data) 
- Legal and ethical issues not fully explored

Potential Applications
========================================================
incremental: true

- Collecting data for Master thesis
  - tell my colleagues you have the skills
  - start now, use later (data collection can take a long time!)
 
- PhD and research master students can "invest" into data collections
  - data was crucial to what I study
  - maybe *you are* a future researcher/PhD student? Start today! 

Academic Opportunities from "what we study"
========================================================
incremental: true

1. Scout out emerging phenomena 
2. Study phenomena that can't be captured otherwise (i.e., unobtrusively)
3. Study diverse populations (e.g., moving being *WEIRD*, more socio-economic backgrounds + geographies)
4. Generating realistic stimuli for experiments (e.g., brand logos)

Academic Opportunities from "how we study" it
========================================================
incremental: true

1. Unleashing real-time data collections (cf. historical)
2. Conduct & support field experiments with a platform's user base
3. Use APIs to *access algorithms*, rather than data (e.g., Google Cloud Vision, OpenAI)
4. Build own [research APIs](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v094i09)
5. Use aggregators & archive.org

<!--
::: notes

  - e.g., new (?) format (live streams rather than lectures)
  - e.g., new content (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks rather than books)
  - ...
-->

Next steps: Projects & SPA
========================================================

- Please hand in so I can __make the data package public__! 
  - Take out any passwords (store as environment variables instead)
  - Remove any unnecessary files
  - Want to keep your names on the documentation or anonymize them? 
  - Don't make statements that are too bold!
  - Consider uploading datasets & documentation yourselves [to Zenodo](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/get/doi/?utm_campaign=referral-short); counted towards "quality" of data package (10% of assignment grade) 

- Re-read the [grading rubric on the course site](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com/docs/course/project/grading/)!

- You will receive __invite to self- and peer assessment__ via email

Exam
=============

- Organization
  - When: 2 April (time tba)
  - Work max. 3 hours on exam
- How?
  - access to TestVision
  - access to Jupyter Notebook
  - I make selected resources [available on the instruction page](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-odcm/raw/master/content/docs/exam/exam-material.zip)
- What?
  - let's look at [some questions now](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com/docs/exam/examplequestions/)
  - prep well! Expect new websites/blogs (for scraping), new endpoints of APIs (that you know)
  - will work with whitelist: blog/website/APIs

Exam tips
========================================================
incremental: true

- Understand how `selenium` and Chrome work, next to the "regular" scraping toolkits (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`
- Practice scraping an unknown website (e.g., tutorials at tilburgsciencehub.com, working with music-to-scrape.org, tilburg.ai, any other blog) -- the scraper will account for a larger number of points on the exam!
- Cover "Fields of Gold" (2022), including the web appendix, sample size calculations and legal concerns (+ reason through challenges) + Guyt et al. 2024 (J Retailing) 

Next steps: Official course evaluation
========================================================

- Course evaluation has been immensely important to this course
  - This edition: developed Journal of Retailing (2024) paper with hands-on guide to scraping, complementing Boegershausen et al. (2022); moved exam to campus
  - Last edition(s): built music-to-scrape.org, host coaching sessions mostly on campus, improved Python onboarding

- Course evaluation has been critical to my career
  - Without my past evaluations, I wouldn't be teaching to you today
  - I will look at all comments
- Scores are most important to show importance of this course

- You will be invited via Evalytics (evaluate [at the end of the week](https://app.evalytics.nl/#/login)).

Informal feedback
===============

- how to ease onboarding?
- how to make sure all software (including Chromedriver is installed)?
- how to handle "switch" from bs4 to selenium?
- is this course too hard? how can I make it 'easier'/'smoother'?
  - e.g., what did you find particularly hard? 
  - what tips would you give to students before they start this course?
  - more online coaching sessions? (or not?)
- Feel you've got enough support?
