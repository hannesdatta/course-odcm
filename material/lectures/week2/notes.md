# Teaching Notes for livestream #3

- Welcome
  - Today, it's about two things: seeking inspiration for scraping and API projects, and trying to understand more about what scrapers and APIs are and how they work
  - How has your first two weeks been at Tilburg?


  - Agenda
    - Polling/quiz to get started; don't worry - it's not graded (?) - if I have time! (check on use of article, etc.)

  - Team sign-up is by next week, and groups have been made available on Canvas
  - There's a "just auditing group" without grading - sign up for that, too if required!

  - A few questions from Mila before we start!
  

  - We'll start w/ the tutorial "Web Data for Dummies"
  - After the break, it's our activity (poll for use of breakout rooms)
  - If no breakout: volunteering students and have a discussion w/ them in front of the class (per topic)
  - Alternatively, Mural
  - Show Figure 2 in web scraping paper: message, that's what we're doing in this class
- Tutorial
  - Let's first pick a website we all find interesting (+ explain why it's important)
  - Let's look at its source code
  - Let's change the source code and observe changes
  - Go over attributes (IDs), classes, and styles
  - CHALLENGE: find a way to locate certain elements: how to get them? w/ attributes? classes? styles? tag words?
  - Load source code into python
  - Remember again why we're using Jupyter Notebook? Who is using something else?!
  - Pointo to concepts like variables, types, lists
  - soup's find vs find_all
  - .get_text()
  - soup.find_all("a", class_="sister")
  - How to proceed from here? Get entire units from the site, save to file.
  - This is what I call a prototype. Not production ready, but somewhat works.
  - Point to topics such as lists, appending, importing packages, and writing functions.
  - You can get started now.

- Reddit
  - Intuition for JSON data at Reddit
  - E.g., extract all of the jokes and write them to a database
  - increase intuition about dictionaries versus lists again
  - show looping through ranges
  - show debugging w/ stackoverflow
  - show writing text files (!)


- Activity
  - do googling first on things you like; put them out there
  - open up google doc from last time; start group allocation: society, business, trendsetter
  - work on breakout activity
