    "# 1. Web Scraping 101\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back!  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Python Bootcamp**, you already learned how to open a web page with `requests`,\n",
    "read a few bits of data using `BeautifulSoup`, and save the result in a file.\n",
    "That was your first small taste of **web scraping**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we‚Äôll take the next step: you‚Äôll build your first\n",
    "**complete web scraper** ‚Äî a short program that automatically collects\n",
    "information from a website and saves it for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does ‚Äúweb scraping‚Äù mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every website you visit (Spotify, IMDb, a news site‚Ä¶) is built with **HTML**.\n",
    "HTML is just a structured text file that tells your browser what to show:\n",
    "where the titles go, which images to load, and so on.\n",
    "- A **web scraper** is a piece of Python code that reads this HTML directly,\n",
    "finds the parts we care about ‚Äî like artist names or song titles ‚Äî\n",
    "and stores them neatly in a table or CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why scrape websites?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the data you need isn‚Äôt available as a CSV or via an API. Instead of copying it by hand, you can let Python do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few quick examples:\n",
    "- Collect product prices from a webshop  \n",
    "- Gather job openings from a company page  \n",
    "- Extract song data from a music website  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get the hang of it, scraping small datasets like these\n",
    "is surprisingly useful ‚Äî and kind of fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #2e7d32; background-color: #e8f5e9; padding: 0.8em 1em; border-radius: 6px;\">\n",
    "  <p>üí° <strong>Why Scrape?</strong></p>\n",
    "  <p>Imagine you find a webpage with a list of songs:</p>\n",
    "  <pre style=\"margin: 0.5em 0; padding: 0.6em; background: #f7f7f7; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;\">Song 1 ‚Äì Artist A\n",
    "Song 2 ‚Äì Artist B\n",
    "Song 3 ‚Äì Artist C</pre>\n",
    "  <p>You could copy-paste by hand‚Äîbut what if there are 100 songs or 100 pages?</p>\n",
    "  <ul>\n",
    "    <li>Visit each page automatically</li>\n",
    "    <li>Grab all titles and artists</li>\n",
    "    <li>Save them neatly into one file</li>\n",
    "  </ul>\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Today's focus: a \"static\" web scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "Some websites are simple: when you open the page, **all the data is already there**\n",
    "in the HTML. These are called **static websites**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a page showing ‚ÄúTop 10 songs of the week‚Äù might list all ten songs\n",
    "right away.   For pages like that, we can simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download** the page‚Äôs HTML using `requests`, and  \n",
    "2. **Extract** what we want using `BeautifulSoup`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the course, we‚Äôll meet **dynamic websites** ‚Äî pages that load content\n",
    "*after* you scroll or click (for example, many shops or streaming sites). For those, we‚Äôll use special tools like Selenium. But before that, let‚Äôs master the simple ‚Äî and much faster ‚Äî static kind first.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What you‚Äôll learn in this tutorial__\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how a web page is structured and where to find your data  \n",
    "- Write a script that downloads several pages automatically  \n",
    "- Handle small issues like missing data  \n",
    "- Be polite to websites by adding short pauses  \n",
    "- Save everything you collected in a clean, reusable format  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each step builds on the previous one, always starting from working code.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"border-left: 4px solid #2e7d32; background-color: #e8f5e9; padding: 0.8em 1em; border-radius: 6px;\">\n",
    "  <p>üí° <strong>Ethical and Legal Use</strong></p>\n",
    "  <ul>\n",
    "    <li>Add short pauses between requests (so you don‚Äôt overload the site)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Don‚Äôt scrape information behind login screens</li>\n",
    "    <li>Never collect personal or private data</li>\n",

    "- The **attribute** (`class`) and **value** (`list-group-item`) gives extra information, e.g., an element we can select for scraping, typically used to group of similar elements. The attribute \"class\" is probably the one you are going to encounter a lot.\n",

    "- When working with files in Python, it's essential to know the difference between <code>'a'</code> and <code>'w'</code>  when opening them.\n",
    "- <code>'a'</code> stands for \"append\" mode. When you open a file with <code>'a'</code> , Python will let you add data to the end of the existing file without erasing its contents. This is useful when you want to add new information to a file without losing what's already there. It's like adding new lines to the end of an ongoing document.\n",
    "- <code>'w'</code>  stands for \"write\" mode. When you open a file with <code>'w'</code> , Python will create a new file or overwrite an existing one. This means that if the file already has data in it, using <code>'w'</code>  will erase all the existing content and start fresh. It's like creating a new document or wiping out the old one.\n",
    "- Remember, when scraping data or working with files, it's generally safer to use <code>'a'</code>. This way, you won't accidentally delete valuable data. Using <code>'w'</code>  should be done with caution, and only when you intentionally want to start with a clean slate or create a new file altogether.\n",
