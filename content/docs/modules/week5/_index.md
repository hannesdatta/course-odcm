# Week 5: Prototype Development
<!--Skill-building <!--+ feedback-->

<!--- Present data extraction plan for chosen website + feedback
<!--*live; same "smaller" groups like before*-->

## Learning goals

- Improve extraction design for your web scraping projects.
- Evaluate data extraction plans on the basis of the suggestions in "Fields of Gold"

## Lecture

- During the lecture, teams will present their data extraction plans. 

## Coaching session

- Please check out the [project page](../../project/workplan/#week-5-prototype-development-coaching-4).

<!--- Optional: Still wonder why APIs are so powerful? Read [Zalando's take](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#introduction) on APIs
-->

## After the lecture and coaching session

- Keep on refining your project. For example, your team can work on the implementation of the scraping/API extraction while the instructor is providing feedback and help whenever required.
  - Start fiddling around with accessing your chosen website or API. 
  - Start building an initial prototype to extract some data (doesn't need to be the "final" data yet!)
