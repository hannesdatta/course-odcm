The activities below help you to structure your project. Stick to the plan to ensure you can finish the project in time.

## Coaching 1: *Idea & Extraction Design*

**Prework**

-   Sign up to teams on Canvas.
-   Pick a data context of interest and identify a potential data source (website/API) that contains data that maybe valuable to the broader research community and industry. Use Table 2 in Boegershausen et al. 2022 for refinement.
-   Write preliminary code to connect to the data source and determine its accessibility.\
-   Design your data extraction plan: decide **what to retrieve**, **which seeds to use**, **how frequently to extract**, and **how to process the data**.\
-   Use *Table 3* in **Boegershausen et al. (2022)** as guidance throughout.

**Deliverable**

-   **Sections 1 and 2** of your data documentation.

## Coaching 2: *Prototype Development*

**Prework**

-   Finalise a **functional prototype** that can extract at least a sample dataset end-to-end.\
-   Implement **monitoring tools** (e.g., logging, rate-limit handling) and decide on **infrastructure**.\
-   Use *Table 4* in **Boegershausen et al. (2022)** throughout.

**Deliverable**

-   **Section 3** of your data documentation.

## Coaching 3: *Refinement & Data Quality*

**Prework**

-   Continue refining your data collection process and, if feasible, complete the extraction.\
-   Inspect the data and perform any necessary **preprocessing** (see Section 4 of your data documentation).

**Deliverable**

-   **Sections 4 and 5** of your data documentation.

## Coaching 4: *Finalise Your Data Package*

**Prework**

-   Finalise your **data documentation** (Sections 1â€“5).\
-   Improve **source code quality** and ensure reproducibility.\
-   Organise the **final submission package** in a clear and consistent directory structure.

**Deliverable**

No deliverables. Prepare for final submission.
